## Research

My main focus of research is in programming langauge semantics where I primarily use
tools from category theory. In particular, I am interested in semantics of computational
effects -- that is, where the computer interacts with the worls such as asking a user for
input or reading and writing to memory. Standard tools for modelling these are monads and
algebraic theories.

The flavours of monads I look at are graded monads and parametrized algebraic theories
which give a notion of effect-usage analysis and dynamic effect instantiation.

I am on a grant for the ARIA programme [Safeguarded AI](https://www.aria.org.uk/opportunity-spaces/mathematics-for-safe-ai/safeguarded-ai/)
that aims to develop mathematical tools to ensure safety standards required for transformational AI.

## Quick Bio

I did a combined undergraduate degree in Australia at the University of Sydney in mechatronic
engineering (majoring in space) and pure mathematics. I completed my honours in mechatronic
engineering with a focus in distributed systems.

I transitioned to the finance industry after graduating, working as a quantitative analyist and
developer for a botique trading firm Tibra based in Wollongong.

After 3 years I made my way back to academia to combine my love for programming and mathematics
by researching semantics of programming languages to build the next generation of versatile,
efficient and interpretable programming languages.
