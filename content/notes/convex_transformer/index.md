title: "A convex monad transformer for imprecise probability"
description: "A short note on the beginnings of a generalisation of the convex powerset construction in the Compositional Imprecise Probability paper to arbitrary (commutative) affine monads.
    I would like to further generalise beyond Set to accommodate extra structure in imprecise probabilities.
    I think this is related to the distributive laws note, but I have not fleshed out the connection yet."
