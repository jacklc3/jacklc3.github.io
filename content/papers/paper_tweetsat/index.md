##### Abstract

The goal of TweetS@ (pronounced Tweet-Sat) is to foster public interest and awareness of space engineering by enabling direct interaction through Twitter. TweetS@ is a 3D printed two-unit CubeSat designed with ease of assembly in mind and is tasked with fulfilling tweet requests for image captures. The structure was verified through structural and thermal simulations and a rocket launch to 10,000 ft. We also present SolarNet, a novel sun vector predictor using a neural network that uses solar panel current and photodiode readings.
